Graph Matching with Partially-Correct Seeds

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of the graph matching method developed in "Graph Matching with Partially-Correct Seeds" by Liren Yu, Jiaming Xu and Xiaojun Lin. See the paper at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.03816.pdf.

**graphmatch_er** folder contains the code to evaluate the performance comparison with synthetic data and to verify the scaling  results.

**graphmatch_auto** folder contains the code to compare the performance on the Autonomous Systems graphs. 

**graphmatch_Facebook** folder contains the code to compare the performance on the Facebook networks. 

**graphmatch_rec** folder contains the code to evaluate the performance on Shrec computer vision dataset, with initial noisy seeds generated by the GRAMPA algorithm.
