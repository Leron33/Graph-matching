This folder contains code to evaluate correspondences on the TOPKIDS dataset using GRAMPA method. 
The complete TOPKIDS dataset can be downloaded on vision.in.tum.de/~laehner/shrec16/.
See Section 3.3 in the paper https://proceedings.icml.cc/static/paper_files/icml/2020/1778-Paper.pdf for details.

1. Use shrec_grampa.m to calculate the geodesic error of gramps for matching kid shape i to shape j.

2. comparison.m evaluates Grampa after the princeton protocol and puts it in comparison to all methods that participated in the SHREC contest. 

At first run, uncomment line 20 to generate grampa matching results for all 90 pairs of test graphs
curves(k,:)=shrec_grampa(i,j,path_kids,track);


At second run, comment line 20 and run the code. 
A figure will be automatically created.
