This folder contains the code to evalute the performance of GRAMPA method on matching autonomous system networks. 

The Autonomous Systems dataset from the University of Oregon Route Views Project http://www.routeviews.org/routeviews/ 
can be download at Stanford Network Analysis Project https://snap.stanford.edu/data/Oregon-1.html
The dataset is also stored as a mat file in subfolder "mat_files".
